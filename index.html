<i>There are four basic ways by which computers can be classified: </i>
</p>
<p>
<ol type="1">
	  <li> Physical size i.e. how large the computer is</li>
	  <li> By the way thy process data</li>
	  <li> By purpose</li>
	  <li> By use</li>
	</ol>

</p>
<h2>1.2.1 PHYSICAL SIZE </h2>
<p> 
The following computer systems are categorized by how large they are;</p>
<h3>A, Monster computer</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is referred to as super computer or max computers. These computers of enormous power and are very large in size. Its installation requires special floors to carry its weight and also needs special plumbing to carry a fluid known as fluorocarbon needed to cool it. One unique feature of maxi computer is that when purchase it, the purchase price will include the services of two permanent engineers to maintain it forever. They are typically used for scientific research and military application, petroleum engineering nuclear physics and meteorology. Examples of monster computer include CYBER and CRAY computers.eg, the whole globe needs only one monster computer to forecast weather at once.
</p>
<h3>B, Mainframe computers </h3>
<p>
They are second in size to Monster computers. These computers perform more data processing work than any other type of computer.
For this reason, they form a large portion of installation inmost organization. They also have some special requirements, for the reason, they are housed in special rooms brought about by the special power that they posses together with the environmental control requirements.
Mainframe computers can be used by more than one person at a time since they can support a large network of other computers organizations that employ mainframe computers alongside other computers are banks, government agencies, commercial and industrial agencies.
</p>
<h3>
C, Minicomputers</h3>
<p>
Are also called Medium sized computers. 
Are smaller, slower and less expensive compared to mainframe computers.
They have an advantage of not having special power or environmental control requirements, thus they can be placed anywhere in the organization and can do the work done by mainframe computers but on small scale.
</p>
<h3>
D, Microcomputers</h3>
<p>
Are the slowest though they have the advantage of easy to use and low purchase price. It is referred to as micro since its microprocess 
or is located in the integrated circuit/chip. They fit nicely on desktops and thus called desktop computers. They are also referred to as personal computers since they are used for personal purposes.
<br>
1.2.2 Type of Data Processed
This classification falls into two main types with the third being a combination of the two.
<ol type="I">
	  <li> Analog</li>
	  <li> Digital</li>
	  <li> Hybrid computers.</li>
	</ol>
	
</p>
<h3>
1.	Analog Computers</h3>
<p>
These computers process data that varies continuously, amount of current flowing in an electrical conductor and so on.
Such computers are used in various scientific applications that require processing of data measured continuously. They are generally called computers that measure things.
</p>
<h3>
2.	Digital Computers</h3>
<p>
They count things. They contain more counting applications than measuring applications.
Data passed through a digital computer is usually operated on in steps i.e. form of discrete numbers.
</p>
<h3>
3.	Hybrid computers</h3>
<p>
They process features of both digital and analog computers meaning both measurement and counting operations are done.
</p>
<h3>
1.2.3 By Purpose Classification</h3>
<p>
 


This classification falls into three categories
a)	Special Purpose Computers
These are single task-oriented computers. They are designed to solve a particular type of a problem e.g. embedded computers in common digital watches.
b)	General Purpose Computer
They computers that can perform a vast number of operations and solve different varieties of problems. They can be adapted with special programs thus becoming special computers too.
c)	Embedded Computers
They are computers attached to other computers that help in operating them e.g. computers embedded in lifts, petrol pumps, digital watches etc.

</p>
<h3>1.2.4 By Use</h3>
<p>
 
In this classification, computers are classified according to what they do and when they do it.<br>
I.	Personal Computers /Desktop Computers<br>
Also known as microcomputers, used on desktop in the office environment or for personal use at home.
<br>
II.	Home Based Computers<br>
An individual may install only games programs or word processor to enable them write letters at home. Some may install accounting packages to enable them budget and control their finances at home.<br>
III.	Lap Top Computers<br>
You can place them on your laps while using them, are very small computers with a briefcase structure. They have their keyboards attached on them, and with a mouse ball and chargeable batteries. They have small slots through which one can attach an external keyboard, mouse or external drives.
